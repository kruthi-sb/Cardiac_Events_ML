# Predictive Analysis of Cardiac Events using Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of cardiac disease using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is the Heart Attack dataset from the UCI repository. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms to build models for prediction. The models are compared and evaluate using various metrics.

## Dataset
The Heart Attack dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about patients who have had a heart attack within the past two years. The dataset includes 14 attributes and 303 observations.
